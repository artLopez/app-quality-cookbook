# Communicating intent

## Motivation

Code that is easier to read is easier to understand. Code that is easier to understand is easier to maintain. Code that is easier to maintain has less bugs. Code that has few bugs is less frightening to deploy. Credit: Javi


## Goals

Gain experience writing code that communicates its intent


## Steps

- Exercise: refactor the code to fn and variable names instead of comments to communicate the intent


## Verify

- Exercise: run tests
- Exercise: push to review


## Reflect

- Reviewer: review code noting if you can still tell what the code does
- Accomplishment: experience with self-documenting code
- Philosophy: simple code is easier to review; reviewed code is easier to maintain; maintained code has fewer bugs; code w/ fewer bugs is less frightening to ship // credit: Javi
