# Testability: communicating intent

## Write

- Exercise: refactor the code to fn and variable names instead of comments to communicate the intent

## Test

- Exercise: run tests
- Exercise: push to review

## Reflect

- Reviewer: review code noting if you can still tell what the code does
- Accomplishment: experience with self-documenting code
- Philosophy: simple code is easier to review; reviewed code is easier to maintain; maintained code has fewer bugs; code w/ fewer bugs is less frightening to ship // credit: Javi
