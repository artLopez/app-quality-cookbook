# Communicating intent

## Goals

* Identify intent
* Write code that communicates its intent

## Motivation

"Code that is easier to read is easier to understand. Code that is easier to understand is easier to maintain. Code that is easier to maintain has less bugs. Code that has few bugs is less frightening to deploy." â€“ [Javi](https://twitter.com/javi)

## Prerequisites

* Spaghetti code

## Steps

### Identifying intent

What is this code intending to do?

If you had an ideal language, how would you express this intent?

### Communicating intent

Translate that idealized form into self-documenting code. If the code is going to be reused, consider creating a domain specific language (DSL).

## Reflect

* When reviewing code, can you tell what it does?
