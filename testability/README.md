# Testability

"There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies."
â€“ C.A.R. Hoare

The phrase "testability" refers to the ease with which code can be tested. Some of the simplest techniques we can embrace are: avoidance of global state, designing with maintenance in mind, and the single-responsibility principle.
