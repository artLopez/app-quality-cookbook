# Testability

"Think about one fundamental question when writing or reviewing code: How am I going to test this?" â€“ Misko Hevery

The phrase "testability" refers to the ease with which code can be tested. Some of the simplest techniques we can embrace are: avoidance of global state, designing with maintenance in mind, and the single-responsibility principle.
