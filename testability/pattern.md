# Refactoring to patterns

## Goals

* Identify a code smell
* Determine an appropriate pattern
* Refactoring the code to a pattern

## Motivation

The culture of design patterns provides us with not only institutional knowledge, but also a shared language we can use to identify issues and approach fixes.

Some static analysis tools will identify standard "code smells" associated with known patterns.

Note: dogmatic adherence to patterns can introduce complexity, so tread lightly

## Prerequisites

* Spaghetti code

## Identifying a smell

## Refactor

## Reflect

* Was it difficult or easy to modify the code before and after the change?
* Was the code smell and resulting change intuitive?
* Was the resulting change an improvement?
