# Single responsibility principle

The single responsibility principle (SRP) is a powerful tool for keeping code clean and easy to understand.

## Prerequisites

* Spaghetti code

## Steps

### Refactor

Modify the spaghetti code we created earlier:
1. extract the identifer type resolution
1. extract the identifer lookup into separate fn
1. extract the user lookup into a separate fn
1. write unit tests for each fn
1. run unit and integration tests

## Reflect

* Was it easy to name these functions?
* Was it easy to test these functions?
* Was it easy to review these functions?
* Was it easy to modify these functions?
