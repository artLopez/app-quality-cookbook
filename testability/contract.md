# Design by contract

## Goals

* Define a contract
* Fulfill the contract, as service and client developers
* Implement tests according to the contract

## Motivation

Designing by contract refers the practice of defining what something is supposed to do, and then building to fit that description. So long as we fulfill the contract, we're free to make changes.

One benefit of defining such a contract is that all users of the service defined by the project can work independently.
