# Managing source code

This section is intended to give you experience with three common tools for maintaining a high-quality code base: version control, issue tracking and code review.

Version control helps us make incremental changes to our code. Issue tracking enables our users to provide feedback. Code review improves the quality of code going into our code base.

We used a few tools to explore these topics: [git](http://git-scm.com/) and [github](https://github.com/).
