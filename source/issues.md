# Issue tracking

Issue tracking tools provide a structured way to collect feedback. In general, an "issue" is a bug you'd like to see fixed or a feature you'd like to see added.

The nature of the product will determine the appropriate tools to use. Since we're focused on software development in this book, we'll use Github's issue tracking to explore the concept.

For example, here's an [issue](https://github.com/Netflix/feign/issues/32) requesting better documentation.

## Creating issues

For each of your group's projects create an issue, as described in [Github's issue tracker documentation](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). The "feature" you request can be simple, like "Add text to this file".

To get experience creating informative issue reports, include the following details:
  * A quick summary
  * What you were trying to do when you noticed the issue
  * Steps to reproduce the issue
  * Error details, like a stacktrace, error message, etc
  * Your environment, eg device type, OS version, app version, etc
  * Let the project owner figure out details like assignee, milestone, labels, etc

* For comparison, [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) is another widely used issue tracker.
* Bitbucket provides an [issue tracker](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Use+the+issue+tracker) that's very similar to Github's
