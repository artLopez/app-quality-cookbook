# Conclusion

We've written spaghetti code and then cleaned it up by avoiding side effects, identifying and abstracting dependencies, communicating intent, designing with patterns in mind, and refactoring our methods to be single-purpose.

The next time you interact with spaghetti code, either directly or in review, you can use this experience to provide effective feedback.

Commit your changes and create another review. This should be the second review for this exercise (so we can easily compare before and after).
