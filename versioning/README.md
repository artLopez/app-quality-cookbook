# Versioning

The central enemy of reliability is complexity. -  Geer et al.

Mutability and immutability are both important concepts in software development.

For example:
* we need to be able to respond quickly to customer feedback (mutability)
* we can reason about something much easier if it does not change (immutability)

Versioning is the act of creating a unique name for a given state. We can then refer to a state by name to preserve functionality.
