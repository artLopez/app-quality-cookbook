# Versioning

"The central enemy of reliability is complexity" -  Geer et al.

Mutability and immutability are both important concepts in software development.

For example:
* we need to be able to respond quickly to customer feedback (mutability)
* we can reason about something much easier if it does not change (immutability)

Versioning is the act of creating a unique identifier for a given state. We can then create a new name when making a change, while preserving the functionality of other versions.
