# Versioning

The Eight Fallacies of Distributed Computing

* The network is reliable
* Latency is zero
* Bandwidth is infinite
* The network is secure
* Topology doesn’t change
* There is one administrator
* Transport cost is zero
* The network is homogeneous

Mutability and immutability are both important concepts in software development.

For example:
* we need to be able to respond quickly to customer feedback (mutability)
* we can reason about something much easier if it does not change (immutability)

Versioning is the act of creating a unique name for a given state. We can then refer to a state by name to preserve functionality.
