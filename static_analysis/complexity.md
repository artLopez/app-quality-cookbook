# Complexity analysis

## Motivation

We can use a complexity analysis tool to help catch flaws in our code.


## Goals

Gain experience performing complexity analysis


## Steps

Run PMD on the commit from Testable 1


## Verify

Observe output from PMD


## Reflect

- Philosophy: compilation and self- and team-review are forms of static analysis
- Did analysis catch anything?
- If so, what? // this should overlap w/ the refactors made above
- Accomplishment: experience with programmatic complexity analysis
- Accomplishment: experience w/ git history
