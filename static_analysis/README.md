# Static analysis

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. â€“ C.A.R. Hoare

Code is "static" in that it doesn't change. So the phrase "static analysis" simply refers to inspection of source code.

Literally speaking, code review is a form of static analysis, however, programmatic analysis is often implied.
