# Code coverage

## Motivation

Code coverage analysis can tell us how many lines of our code are touched by our tests.

Having 100% coverage doesn't guarantee freedom from bugs, in part because our tests don't cover all usage patterns, but it can help us identify under-maintained portions of our code.
