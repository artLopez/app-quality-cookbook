# Code coverage

## Goals

* Identify an appropriate tool
* Generate and interpret a code coverage report

## Motivation

Code coverage analysis can tell us how many lines of our code are touched by our tests.

Having 100% coverage doesn't guarantee freedom from bugs, in part because our tests don't cover all usage patterns, but it can help us identify under-maintained portions of our code.

## Steps

### Tooling

An appropriate tool should:
* be runnable from the command line
* generate machine-readable output for CI

### Reporting
