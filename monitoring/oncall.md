# On-call rotation

## Goals

* Identify people involved in rotation
* Identify appropriate tool for coordination

## Motivation

Serving as a point of contact for app bugs is stressful. To reduce stress and increase availability, define an "on-call" rotation.

## Steps

### Rotation members

A rotation should have:
* enough people to allow everyong downtime when they are not on call, eg ~10
* a secondary assignment in case the primary assignment cannot be reached

A rotation should be discoverable 

### Tooling

An on call system should:
* alert members when they are going on-call
* enable members to swap placement
* be discoverable to answer the question "who is on-call for this service?"

A simple example would be a periodic calendar entry on a shared on-call cal.
