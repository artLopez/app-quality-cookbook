h1. Section 2

Integration testing
Testability
Static analysis










h2. Testable 5
Write
- Exercise: refactor the code to fn and variable names instead of comments to communicate the intent
Test
- Exercise: run tests
- Exercise: push to review
Reflect
- Reviewer: review code noting if you can still tell what the code does
- Accomplishment: experience with self-documenting code
- Philosophy: simple code is easier to review; reviewed code is easier to maintain; maintained code has fewer bugs; code w/ fewer bugs is less frightening to ship // credit: Javi


h2. Static analysis 2
Write
- Lesson: PMD
- Exercise: check out the commit from Testable 1
Test
- Exercise: run PMD
Reflect
- Philosophy: compilation and self- and team-review are forms of static analysis
- Did analysis catch anything?
- If so, what? // this should overlap w/ the refactors made above
- Accomplishment: experience with programmatic complexity analysis
- Accomplishment: experience w/ git history
