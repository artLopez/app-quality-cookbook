# Testability: single responsibility principle

## Write

- Exercise: refactor the fn as follows:
-- extract the identifer type resolution
-- extract the identifer lookup into separate fn
-- extract the user lookup into a separate fn

## Test

- Exercise: write unit tests for each fn
- Exercise: run unit and integration tests

## Reflect

- Writer: was it difficult or easy to modify this fn?
- Writer: was it difficult or easy to write a test for this fn?
- Reviewer: was it more easy or difficult to review these changes?
- Reviewer: are the comments still accurate?
- Accomplishment: experience with SRP
