# Drawing exercise

## Goals

Explore quality engineering principles in a simplified environment

## Motivation

Quality engineering concepts can be obscured by technical details

## Steps

### Solo development

1. Think of a shape
1. Draw this shape on paper
1. Verify the shape drawn was the one intended

Note that because you are the "customer" as well as the "developer" the feedback loop is very small

### Paired development

1. Think of another, more complex shape
1. Ask the person to your right to draw it
1. Verify the shape was the one intended

Was the shape correct?
Did you have to make any corrections while drawing?

### Waterfall development

1. Think of another complex shape
1. Ask the person to your right to draw it
1. Do not provide any guidance after providing the definition
1. Verify the shape was the one intended

Did have to document the definition?
Was the resulting shape correct?
