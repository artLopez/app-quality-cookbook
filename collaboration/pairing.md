# Pairing

## Motivation

We often write software in close conjunction with another person. Extreme programming introduced formal pair programming, which some businesses, eg Pivotal, Thought Works, etc., adhere to more closely than others.

Pairing can be more fun, fault tolerant, and produce higher quality results, but it may not always be appropriate.

## Goals

* Gain experience with pair programming

## Steps

1. Pair up
1. Identify the person who will "drive"
1. Implement a change
1. Post the change for review by a third person

## Reflect

As a member of a pair, how did the experience compare with writing code individually?

As a reviewer, was the change of higher quality?
