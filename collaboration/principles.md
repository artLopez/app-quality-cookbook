# Shared principles

## Goals

* List shared principles

## Motivation

Development can be stressful if the people involved have different priorities, and/or no objective standard. To alleviate this, we can agree on a set of guidelines.

For example, Twitter has 10 high-level "engineering principles":
* Portfolio Approach
* Automation
* Ownership
* Consistency
* Iterative, team-based development
* Teamwork
* Simplicity and Quality
* Flexibility
* Appropriate re-use
* Customer Focus

Best-practice: automate enforcement as much as possible to increase objectivity.

## Steps

### Identify principles

Work with your team to identify ~5 qualities you would like in your development environment

### Use principles

Practice refering to them when coordinating activities

## Reflect

Did this have an effect on your communication?
