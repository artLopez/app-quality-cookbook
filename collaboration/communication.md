# Communication

Effective communication can help build confidence.

Code reviews will be more efficient if the reviewer understands the intent of the code.

Releases will be more calm if everyone knows what is being released, when the deploy is happening, and who is managing the deploy.

Issues can be resolved more quickly if the person experiencing the issue can communicate with people who can implement a fix.

## Steps

### Introduce an issue

### Create review

* quick summary
* problem to solve
* testing details

### Identify release manager

The release manager will prepare, build, and deploy the release, and serve as a single point of contact.

### Announce deploy

Before deploying, announce the deploy by sending an email with the following:
* changes list
* planned time

### Announce deploy status

After deploying, announce the status of the deploy by replying on the announcement thread.

### Report issue

Report an issue:
* quick summary
* estimated impact
* steps to reproduce the issue
* environment details
