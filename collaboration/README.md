# Collaboration

"I think, fundamentally, open source does tend to be more stable software. It's the right way to do things." 
â€“ Linus Torvalds

Software development in a company setting is rarely a solitary activity. Often it is actually a liability as an engineer working alone misses out on feedback from customers and other engineers. To reduce risk, we have several collaborative development techniques, including communication patterns, paired programming, and shared engineering principles.
