# Collaboration

I think, fundamentally, open source does tend to be more stable software. It's the right way to do things. â€“ Linus Torvalds

Large-scale software development is often performed by teams of people. Effective communication can help build confidence.

Code reviews will be more efficient if the reviewer understands the intent of the code.

Releases will be more calm if everyone knows what is being released, when the deploy is happening, and who is managing the deploy.

Issues can be resolved more quickly if the person experiencing the issue can communicate with people who can implement a fix.
