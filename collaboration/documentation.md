# Documentation

## Goals

* Balance documentation with maintainability
* Implement class and method level header comments
* Use JavaDoc to generate documentation
* Tie a TODO comment with a tracking ticket

## Motivation

We spend time during development to obtain full understanding of the problem. Documentation preserves this investment.

Note: beware of stale documentation; the recommendations below strive for a balance of coverage and maintainability.

## Steps

### Class headers

Document at the class level

### Function headers

Only document public interfaces

### TODO

Tie "TODO" comments to an owner and implementation plan by referencing a bug ticket

### Automation

Generate programmatic documentation in CI
