# Conclusion

We used a simplified drawing exercise to start exploring quality engineering themes such as the cost of delivery vs the cost of process, iterative development, collaboration, and static analysis.

We created a Linux virtual machine using Vagrant. We used this virtual machine to establish a consistent development environment. Going forward, you could use a similar set of tooling to emulate a remote service for local development.

We learned how to navigate the Linux file system and manipulate files from the command line, an invaluable skill set for remote debugging.

We wrapped up by starting to use and IDE for development and debugging. IDEs provide powerful tools like code completion and syntax highlighting we can use to produce high quality code.
