# Set up

This section focuses on introducing some basic quality engineering concepts and tools we can use to explore them.

We'll start with a simple drawing exercise touching on the fundamentals of development and quality control.

Next, we'll dive into Unix, which provides the basis for many of the operating systems we interact with. We'll use it to establish a consistent development environment for all the examples used in this book.

We'll use Vagrant to define a Linux virtual machine. Vagrant is widely used for automating virtual machine management.

We'll explore Vim, a common text editor, and use it to dive into Java, which we'll use for a variety of applications throughout this course.

We'll use the Java compiler as a simple static analysis tool to start analyzing our code.

We'll wrap up by introducing an integrated development environment (IDE) called IntelliJ we can use to improve the quality of our code.
