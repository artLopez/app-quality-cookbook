# A conceptual overview

Quality engineering concepts can be obscured by technical details. We can avoid this by starting with simple tools. Grab a pen and paper.

## Solo development

We often develop alone when we're getting started with an idea.

1. Think of a shape
1. Draw this shape on paper
1. Verify the shape drawn was the one intended

This shape is our product.

Was it produced correctly?

Because you are the "customer" as well as the "developer" the feedback loop is very small. The cost of shipping this product was a piece of paper and some time to draw the shape. Your audience is just yourself.

## Collaboration

Pair up with another person.

1. Think of another shape
1. Ask the person to draw it
1. Verify the shape was the one intended

Was it produced correctly?

What steps did you go through to verify it was produced correctly?

If you were to do this exercise again, would you do anything differently to ensure the shape was drawn correctly?

For example, would written requirements have helped?
