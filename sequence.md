# A suggested reading sequence

In the spirit of iteration, I recommend introducing core concepts and then building up.

## 1

1. [preface](preface.md) tldr and goals
1. Drawing exercises 1, 2, and 3

Concepts:

* How do you know if the shape is drawn correctly?
* If we don't get feedback, how do we know if we've drawn a shape correctly?
* Was it easier to draw the shape correctly with feedback?

## 2

1. [preface](preface.md) bias toward scope over quality wrt solo development
1. [Unix intro](tools/unix.md)
1. [Unix fs and ssh exercise](](exercises/unix.md))
1. [Vim intro](tools/vim.md)
1. [Vim exercise](tools/vim.md)
1. [Java intro](tools/java.md)
1. [Java exercise 1](exercises/java.md)
1. [Static analysis intro](static_analysis/README.md)
1. [Lint intro](static_analysis/lint.md)
1. JDB intro
1. [Testing theory 1](testing/README.md)
1. [Version control intro](version_control/README.md)
1. [Git intro](tools/git.md)
1. [Java exercise 2](exercises/java.md)

Concepts:
* How efficiently can we write code with a simple text editor?
* How confident are we in code written in a text editor?
* Does running code through a compiler help improve confidence?
* Does the compiler help identify problems?
* How do you know if our code is working correctly?
* How do you fix issues as they are discovered?

## 3

1. Maven intro
1. [IntelliJ intro](tools/intellij)
1. [Review group exercise](exercises/grouper.md)
1. Over-the-shoulder code review

1. Unit testing intro
1. Integration testing intro
1. JUnit intro
1. JUnit exercise
1. Bug resolution exercise
1. Pull request exercise
1. Pairing exercise
1. Javadoc intro

Concepts:
* Was it easier to write code in an IDE vs vim?
* Do you feel more confident with code written in an IDE?
* Did you have less compiler errors from code written in an IDE?
* Did you feel more confident after tests were added?
* Do you feel more confident about changes made while pairing?

## 4

1. Testability intro
1. Spaghetti code exercise
1. Static analysis intro
1. Checkstyle intro
1. PMD intro
1. JaCoCo intro
1. Single responsibility intro
1. Single responsibility exercise

1. Refactoring to patterns exercise
1. Communicating intent intro
1. Communicating intent exercise
1. Documentation intro
1. Javadoc intro
1. Fractional config exercise
1. Code review

Concepts:
* Did you find testability patterns like dependency injection made code easier to reason about and test?
* Did documentation make code easier to understand?
* Does static analysis help you feel more confident about the code base?
