# Testing

More than the act of testing, the act of designing tests is one of the best bug preventers known. The thinking that must be done to create a useful test can discover and eliminate bugs before they are coded. â€“ Boris Beizer

Three commonly used, broad categories of testing:
* Unit
* Integration
* Functional

As Martin Fowler describeds in his [Test Pyramid](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html) article, we should build on a base of unit tests, as these are the easiest to reason about and the fastest to run.
