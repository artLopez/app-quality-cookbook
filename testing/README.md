# Testing

"More than the act of testing, the act of designing tests is one of the best bug preventers known. The thinking that must be done to create a useful test can discover and eliminate bugs before they are coded."
â€“ Boris Beizer

How do we know a piece of code is correctly implemented? The goal of testing it to assert correctness.
