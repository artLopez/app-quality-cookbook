# Device testing

## Motivation

Building a product that works correctly on a variety of devices is a significant challenge. Web and Android are particulary fragmented.

Device testing can help ensure our app will work well everywhere it is installed.

Best-practice: testing on live devices is failure-prone due to updates. Prefer emulators.

## Goals

* Identify appropriate device tests
* Use the Android Emulator to define multiple devices
* Run tests on multiple devices
* Automate device testing

## Prerequisites

* Android
