# Preface

## Tldr

"Simplicity is a prerequisite for reliability" â€“ Edsger Dijkstra

## Purpose

This book is intended to introduce a few common tools and concepts we can use to improve engineering quality for app development.

My goal is to help more developers ship code with confidence.

## Methodology

The recommendations in this book come from my personal experience, interviews with colleagues, production-readiness recommendations from site reliability engineers, guidelines from architecture groups, and publications.

## Structure

I call this a "cookbook" because it focuses on a set of verifiable outcomes, like the recipes in a cookbook.

Each section of this book defines the why, what, and how for a given topic, expressed as "motivation", "goals", and "steps".

## Biases

This book biases toward accommodating inexperienced developers, developing applications, cutting scope over quality, holding systems responsible, collaborating, iterating, and having fun.

### Accessibility

A broad range of developers can use the tools in this book, but to ensure accessibility, I include the basics for getting started.

### App development

I have experience with quality engineering as a Web and Android application developer, and write from this perspective, but I also keep portability in mind.

### Cutting scope over quality

If the cost of shipping something is high, then I place more emphasis on up-front quality. For example, hacking on something for myself is relatively low cost, and I skip a lot of quality tooling. Developing a physical product for a paying customer, however, is high cost - the product _must_ work - and investment in quality tooling is justified. In a pinch, I recommend erring on the side of quality, i.e., "cut scope, not quality."

### Responsible systems

I recommend relying on systems rather than individuals. A team can deterministically improve a system, and that system can outlive the individuals on the team. Given it's human to make mistakes, I prefer to work in an environment that minimizes damage.

### Collaboration

I recommend against developing code in isolation to reduce stress and increase quality. Software development is often a collaborative activity.

### Iteration

I recommend shipping small changes frequently to reduce risk and facilitate maintenance and damage control. With this in mind, this book is organized such that each page provides incremental value.

I think of software development as a series of fundamental activities, reminiscent of the scientific method: making a change, observing the result, reflecting on the outcome, planning for the next change. Each section in this book is organized in this way.

### Enjoyment

Building products can be enjoyable, but shipping unpredictable applications via unforgiving systems is a terrible experience. Quality engineering helps me focus on the former.
