This book introduces a few common tools we can use to improve engineering quality.

By tools, I mean software as well as approaches to software development.

By engineering quality, I mean tools used to maintain quality during development, as opposed to quality assurance, which I define as a set of manual steps performed to assert a finished product works correctly.

This book biases toward developing applications, cutting scope over quality, holding systems responsible, collaboration, and iteration.

I have experience with quality engineering as a Web and Android application developer, and write from this perspective, but I also keep portability in mind.

If the cost of shipping something is high, then I place more emphasis on up-front quality. For example, hacking on something for myself is low cost, and I skip a lot of quality tooling. Developing a physical product for a paying customer, however, is high cost - the product must work - and investment in quality tooling is justified. In a pinch, I recommend erring on the side of quality, i.e., "cut scope, not quality."

I recommend relying on systems rather than individuals. A team can deterministically improve a system, and that system can outlive the individuals on the team. To err is human, so I prefer to work in an environment that minimizes damage.

I recommend against developing code in isolation to reduce stress and increase quality. Software development is often a collaborative activity.

I recommend shipping small changes frequently to reduce risk and facilitate maintenance and damage control.

I think of software development as a series of fundamental activities, reminiscent of the scientific method: making a change, observing the result, reflecting on the outcome and planning for the next change. Each section in this book is organized in this way.

I think building products should be enjoyable. Quality engineering can help keep it that way.

Happy hacking :)
