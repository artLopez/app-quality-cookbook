# Issue tracking

Issue tracking tools provide a structured way to collect feedback.

The nature of the product will determine the appopriate tools to use.

Since we're focused on software development in this book, we'll use Github's issue tracking to explore the concept.

## Prerequisites

* [Github](../tools/github.md)

## Creating issues

1. Identify an issue in a project
1. Create an issue, as described in [Github's issue tracker documentation](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
1. Structure your issue report to include:
  * A quick summary
  * What you were trying to do when you noticed the issue
  * Steps to reproduce the issue
  * Error details, like a stacktrace, error message, etc
  * Your environment, eg device type, OS version, app version, etc
  * Let the project owner figure out details like assignee, milestone, labels, etc
