# Debuggers

Debuggers enable us to examine running code by:
* Setting a breakpoint to pause execution 
* Step over a line
* Step into a function
* Step out of a function
* Continue to the next breakpoint
* Show the lines of code around a breakpoint
* Show the contents of a variable in the current scope

We can use the IntelliJ debugger to explore these concepts.

## Steps

### Setting a breakpoint

Click the left gutter next to the line on which you'd like to set the breakpoint

### Launching the debugger

Click Run > Debug from the top navbar

### Stepping over a line

Click the "Step Over" button in the stepping toolbar

### Stepping into a function

If the current step is a function call, click the "Step Into" button in the stepping toolbar to examine the function's execution

### Stepping out of a function

If you've stepped into a function, click the "Step Out" button to exit the function

### Continuing to the next breakpoint

Click the "Resume Program" button

### Show the contents of a variable

Hover over a variable to see its contents
