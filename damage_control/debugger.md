# Debuggers

Debuggers enable us to examine running code by:
* Setting a breakpoint to pause execution 
* Step over a line
* Step into a function
* Step out of a function
* Continue to the next breakpoint
* Show the lines of code around a breakpoint
* Show the contents of a variable in the current scope

We can use the IntelliJ debugger to explore these concepts.

## Steps

1. Set a breakpoint
1. Launch the debugger
1. Step over a line
1. Step into a function
1. Step out of a function
1. Continue to the next breakpoint
1. Show the contents of a variable
