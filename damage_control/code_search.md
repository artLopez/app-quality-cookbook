# Code search

## Goals

* Gain experience with a code search tool, eg github's search

## Motivation

When investigating an issue, eg finding an unexpected string in output, it is helpful to be able to search your code base, especially across repositories.

## Steps

### git log

### git log -p

### git grep

### Search by keyword

### Search by repository

### Search by language

### Search by sha

Hack: find the repo via Google: https://www.google.com/search?q=0bade558646a133347a46475ce53dca91c29a1b4
