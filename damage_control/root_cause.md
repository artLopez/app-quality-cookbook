# Investigation

## Motivation

We investigate bugs as they are discovered to determine the _root cause_.


## Goals

* Identify a bug at runtime
* Determine the root cause
* Determine the change responsible
* Identify remediation


## Steps

### Create bug

1. Pair up
1. Define an "investigator" who will investigate an issue create by the other person
1. Create a bug, build and deploy
1. Have the investigator exercise the app and observe the bug

### 5 whys

The investigator asks "why" repeatedly, iteratively drilling into the answers. Usually the root cause is identified after five iterations
