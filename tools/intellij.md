# IntelliJ

## Goals

* Install
* Verify installation

## Motivation

IntelliJ is widely used, so we'll benefit from a large community. It's also best-of-breed, so it's advantageous to use. It provides syntax parsing, and it can be configured to run external tools, which will help us write better code, more quickly.

## Prerequisites

* Vagrant

## Steps

### Install

The [virtual machine associated with this book](tools/vagrant.md) will manage installation. Please refer to the [machine's configuration](../Vagrantfile) for more details.

### Verify

Follow [Jetbrainâ€™s instructions for a hello world app](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/creating-and-running-your-first-java-application.html).
