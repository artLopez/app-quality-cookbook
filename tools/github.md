# Github

Github is widely used and provides an excellent interface for working with remote repositories.

## Prerequisites

* [Git](git.md)

## Create account

Create an account if you donâ€™t have one already. It's free for open source projects.

## Create a new repository

A repository is used to store code.

Follow [Github's documentation for creating a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/)

## Configuring git locally

[Github's set-up documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) describes how to configure your local environment so you can talk to github.

## Cloning a repository

We clone a repository to make a copy we can work with locally.

The clone is aware of the repository it was cloned from, so we can push our changes back to it.

Follow [Github's documentation for working with remote repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/), which describes cloning.
