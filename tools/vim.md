# Vim

Having a tool to quickly edit a file from the Unix command line is handy.

For example, we frequently log into remote Unix machines, where IntelliJ is not installed. However, vim generally is.

## Verify

Verify vim is installed:

```
$ vim --version
VIM - Vi IMproved 7.4 (2013 Aug 10, compiled Jan  2 2014 19:40:04)
...
```
