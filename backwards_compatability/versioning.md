# Versioning

## Motivation

Mutability and immutability are both important concepts in software development. 

For example, we need to respond quickly to customer feedback (mutability); reasoning about something is much easier if it does not change (immutability).

Versioning is the act of creating a unique identifier for a given state. This gives us the ability to change a product while preserving a consistent state. In other words, we can increment a version number when introducing new functionality and we will not break old versions.

## Goals

* API versioning
* Latest vs fixed
