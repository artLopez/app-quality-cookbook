# Launch configuration

Some configuration can be defined when an app is launched. For example, if we want to disable caching in local development, we can communicate an app's environment to the app via command line arguments.

## Steps

1. Define command line argument to communicate the runtime environment
1. Define application helpers
1. Configure a feature to be enabled when local
1. Start service locally
1. Observe feature is enabled when running locally
1. Deploy service
1. Observe feature is disabled
