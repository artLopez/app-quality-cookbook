# Service development

In this section, we'll
* create a feature switch service using the code you wrote in the [maintainability section](maintainability.md)
* gain experience with fractional, staged, and automated deployment
* gain experience with build-, launch-, and run-time configuration
* use configuration and version control for damage control
* touch on versioning endpoints for backwards compatability
* use tracing and analytics to monitory app usage
* use dynamic routing to facilitate testing in different environments
* expand on our dependency injection (DI) experience using Dagger 2
* learn about redline testing
